GARCON testproject

The garcon build tools now include binary dependencies, so no compilation is necessary.

To install the test project:

git clone git://github.com/mauritslamers/garcon-testproject
git submodule update --init
npm install

To run:

node gettingstarted.js

Then in your browser:

http://localhost:8000/todos_one
http://localhost:8000/todos_two
http://localhost:8000/todos_three
http://localhost:8000/showcase (see instructions below)

And of course: try out your projects and please let me know if anything is running different than expected.
It would be great if you can provide a pull request, but feel free to also post issues at

== Instructions for the showcase app ==

Because of the more strict way the nodejs buildtools deal with sc_requires, the showcase app needs extra sc_requires
in resources/views_page.js. 

Before trying the showcase app, please copy the following list and paste it above the view code in 
showcase/resources/views_page.js

sc_require('views/button_views');
sc_require('views/checkbox_views');
sc_require('views/container_views');
sc_require('views/date_field_views');
sc_require('views/disclosure_views');
