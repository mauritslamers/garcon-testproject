GARCON testproject

The garcon build tools now include binary dependencies, so no compilation is necessary.

To install the test project:

git clone git://github.com/mauritslamers/garcon-testproject
git submodule update --init
npm install

To run:

node gettingstarted.js

Then in your browser:

http://localhost:8000/todos_three

And of course: try out your projects and please let me know if anything is running different than expected.
