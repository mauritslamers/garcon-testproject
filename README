GARCON testproject

Prerequisites:

You need to have a compiler installed. 
You might have to install the cairo package if it is not already on your system.

For Mac OSX Lion (10.7) users: the right version of cairo is on your system

For Mac OSX Snow Leopard users (10.6) (and probably older version too):
The version installed is too old. There is a easy way to circumvent this problem, 
which is to use HomeBrew to install the right version.

- If you already did npm install, first remove the node_module directory from the root
folder of the project. 
- install cairo with homebrew.
- next follow the install instructions below, but run the 'npm install' step as follows:

PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/cairo/1.10.2/lib/pkgconfig npm install

This will make sure that the version installed by homebrew is picked up by pkg-config 
(pkg-config selects the cairo version used)

To install:

git clone git://github.com/mauritslamers/garcon-testproject
git submodule update --init
npm install

To run:

node gettingstarted.js

Then in your browser:
